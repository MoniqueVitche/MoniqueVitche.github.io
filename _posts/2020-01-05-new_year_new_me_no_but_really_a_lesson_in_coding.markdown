2019 was a tough year, but it also had some wonderful moments. I decided to start Flatiron in 2019, after all. It hasn't always been easy but I suppose that's the point of bootcamps. 

My biggest blocker that I've been dealing with is time management. Although I currently work part-time while I am doing this bootcamp, I have found it hard to manage my household responsibilities and school. I paused my learning in September until November, but I've still struggled with getting back on track.

But 2020 is a new year, a fresh start.

One of my goals for this year is to finish this bootcamp. I owe it to myself to finish. 

How am I going to go about doing that, though?

I plan on dedicating 20-25 hours minimum to coding and study each week. It doesn't sound like **a lot** in the grand scheme of things, but it's a pace that I'm comfortable with. Before I wanted to dedicate 40+ hours toward course work and well, that failed spectacularly. If there's anything I have learned though in my professional life, better to fail fast if you're going to fail at all. It was a learning curve.

I also plan on staying more organized than I was last year. Yeah, this may be a tech bootcamp, but I am old school and will keep a planner dedicated to what I've accomplished each day.

Thanks for sticking with me on this journey.
