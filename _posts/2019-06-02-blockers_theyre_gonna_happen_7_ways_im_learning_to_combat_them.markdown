It's been almost one month since I started my Flatiron School journey, and I've hit some blockers along the way. Some of it was time management--adjusting to a change in my schedule and trying to balance work and other priorities with school--and some of it was personal stuff. Although I can't always control the personal stuff thrown my way (life tends to enjoy throwing curve balls), I can control the time management part. I have ADHD and sometimes it's hard to stay on task, even with medication.

Here's what I'm doing, or planning to do, to stay on track:

## 1. Use time management apps

I had downloaded [Be Focused - Focus Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973130201?mt=8) (free) app from the App Store a while back when I got my new computer. I like it because it utilizes the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes working, 5 minutes break), which usually works best for me. The only times I will skip the 5 minutes break is if I am in engrossed in something with which I'm making a lot of progress.

Another app that I need to get in the habit of using is [Self-Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) (free). It's another Mac app that blocks certain websites for a number of hours that you set. For example, if I find that I am too distracted by Facebook or Twitter, I can block both of those websites from working on my computer for the 2 hours I want to code today.

## 2. Get enough sleep

This one is probably one of the hardest ones for me. I struggle with getting enough sleep, and a good night's sleep at that. I use Sleep Cycle (free both for iOS and Android) to track my sleeping habits/patterns and try to address how to improve my sleep quality. I noticed that I will sleep better on nights where there is white noise from a fan or air conditioner and my TV is off. Sleeping better and for the amount of hours that I need is important for me to be at my best and able to focus on the tasks ahead.

## 3. Create a schedule -- and stick to it

I love making schedules. I have a whiteboard with my work schedule listed on it and another whiteboard outlining goals and projects both related to and not related to school (I write and work with fiber crafts outside of work and school). I also keep a paper planner. This sounds a little silly perhaps to be keeping a paper planner in 2019, but I find it to be really helpful when it comes to remembering appointments and other things, like remembering I was going to code from 5pm to 8pm after work.

An example schedule would look something like this in my planner:

**Monday** 
*7am* wake up/take meds/eat breakfast
*8am* code for 3 hours
*11am* work until 3pm (includes time for lunch)
*3:30pm* gym until 4:30pm
*5pm* dinner/shower
*6pm* code until 9pm
*9pm* knit/crochet/read
*11pm* bed

My weekday will change from day to day as I work different set hours each day. Weekends ideally would look like this. I say ideally, because sometimes things come up and I have to shift things around a bit, but I do want to get 8-9 hours of coding done each weekend day.

**Saturday**
*8am* wake up/take/meds/eat breakfast
*9am* code for 3 hours
*12pm* lunch/errands
*2pm* code for 3 hours
*5pm* dinner/shower/write
*7pm* code for 3 hours
*10pm* read/knit/crochet until bed

Another pro to having a paper planner? I get journal prompts at the beginning of each month as well as throughout the weeks. I use [Adam J. Kurtz's Unsolicited Advice planner](https://www.amazon.com/Unsolicited-Advice-2019-Weekly-Planner/dp/0996907246) and I find that it's more engaging and I learn about my overall habits than I do with a traditional planner.

## 4. Use resources available to you

Learning new things, especially something like coding, can be challenging at times. I rely on (not heavily) some resources including similar courses I have completed through Udemy and Coursera. I also know a Flatiron School alumnus who has been really kind in helping me along the way whenever I get stuck. If you don't have these particular resources, I recommend utilizing the AAQ feature. There are no silly questions, in my opinion, so don't feel embarrassed if you find yourself stuck on a lab or you're not quite getting the lesson material. We're here not just to learn, but also to help each other out. We're all in the same boat.

## 5. Set goals

These goals don't have to huge goals. They could be as small as treating yourself to an ice cream after completing X number of lessons and labs. Or it could be a bigger goal, complete a project and get a day off to relax or hang with friends. Which leads me to my next point...

## 6. Remember to make time for relaxation and socializing

As much as we might want to code code code all the time, it's probably not the best thing to do because it could potentially lead to burning out. I know I don't want that. It's imperative to spend time with loved ones and recharge a bit. Allow yourself to relax and take breaks as you need to. Don't overdo it, but find a happy medium where you are not burning the candle at both ends.

## 7. Have fun

This is perhaps the most important part. Yes, it's school work. Yes, it's going to be challenging. But it's also going to be fun. You're learning new material and gaining new skillsets, and it's important to have fun with it. Create engaging projects that are of interest to you. Think of what you might want in an app and build it. If you look at school work as simply *work* or you don't find it interesting, you're not going to want to put in the work. I know that has always been a huge pitfall of mine, but I am finding coding to be both fun and challenging. 

Maybe you find these ways might help you too if you're struggling with blockers. I know I am going to do my best to stick to all of these methods. Time to get back to coding. I'll check in with you all later.
