To say that 2020 has been a whirlwind and a half is quite the understatement. Who knew when I decided to enroll in Flatiron's Full Stack Web Development course that we were going to be dealing with a global health crisis and I was going to have to deal with some changes in my personal life as well. I became a caregiver and took on a lot more responsibilities as a result. Unfortunately, that meant that Flatiron had to take a bit of a backseat.

But I'm back... and I mean it.

With the support of some of my friends and family, I have the goal of completing the program by the end of May 2021. That means I have to really kick things into high gear.

I can do it though. I have a lot more support this time. What held me back previously was not much in-person support. I learned that it's important and necessary sometimes to ask for help. That it's not a good thing to do everything yourself. It's better to be proud of looking for support when you need it than self-sabotaging. And that can applied to completing Flatiron. 

There's nothing in this world I want more than to complete this program. In fact, it's at the top of my 2021 goals and I see it every single day when I sit at my desk.

Here's to new beginnings...

Let's do this.
