I decided to study software development for the following reasons:

* I am self-taught in HTML, CSS and Python
* I am looking to improve my skills to expand my hirability and improve my career goals
* It was something that I was able to fall back on following my initial plan not working out

I have always held an interest in coding. I self-taught HTML and CSS when I was in middle school so I could make layouts for my blogs on Xanga and LiveJournal (and, later, MySpace layouts). I never thought that I would be able to make a career out of coding, and instead decided to pursue my love of writing.

I majored in political science and journalism while in university, but struggled to find a job in my field upon graduation and graduate school for journalism did not work out (my plan was to attend Columbia and train to become an investigative reporter). I turned back to coding and self-taught Python.

Still unsure that I could make this into a career, I put it back to the side as I took on a number of odd jobs (mostly in customer service). My partner at the time enrolled in Flatiron School and completed it last year. I saw them work diligently through the course and thought to myself, "Maybe I can do this."

With their support, I decided to enroll in the program and give it a whirl. I currently work as an Associate Mental Health Editor for a website, and I hope to combine my interest-turned-passion for coding and love of writing into a career I love.
